# Powershell Script
# Create a CSV that will contain an image filename, height and width

Do you have a folder full of images?
Do you need the height and width of those images?
Do you want that data in a CSV?
THIS IS THE SCRIPT FOR YOU!!

Ok but really, it's not fancy.  Go ahead and use it

It's set up right now for just JPG and PNG.
Change it as you see fit.

----------------------------------------------

Ok but for real, if you have never used powershell before...here's a quick way to implement this script.  Imma go SUPER laymans terms here...so sorry-not-sorry.  I figure my target audience might be someone like maybe a semi-tech-savvy grandma who just got a cool DSLR camera and wants to show off to her grandkids.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

..........or maybe it's targeted to someone who has to make a CSV to upload to a CMS and load in some metadata...and doing it manually one-by-one is totally a buzz-kill.


1. Click on the little windows icon in the bottom left corner.
2. Start typing "Powershell"
3. You're gunna see a couple of things pop up...We're looking for "Windows Powershell ISE"
4. RIGHT CLICK on it.
5. Click on "Run as Administrator"
6. Ok cool, it's opening.
7. Copy-pasta the text that's in this repo "powershell.ps1"
8. Skim down that code and find the $folder.  Change that to wherever your images are stored.
9. Click the little green "play" arrow button.
10. You should now have a fancy CSV!!


Thanks for playing along!  Hope ya'll have an awesome day.
